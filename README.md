## Laravel Project Structure

### File Structure

CityEye Hospital's codebase is meticulously organized following Laravel 10.0.0 standards. Let's explore key directories and their functionalities in detail:

- **app:** The epicenter of the application's logic. This includes:
  - Console: Commands to run Artisan tasks.
  - Exceptions: Custom exception handlers.
  - Http: The workhorse, housing controllers, middleware, and requests.
  - Models: Eloquent models representing database entities.
  - Providers: Service providers that bootstrap various components.

- **bootstrap:** Initialization scripts and the app.php file for bootstrapping the Laravel application.

- **config:** Configuration files that govern the behavior of the application, including app.php, database.php, and more.

- **database/migrations:** The version-controlled history of database schema changes, allowing for seamless updates.

- **public:** The root directory for publicly accessible assets, such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

- **resources:** Holds assets, views, and language files.
  - lang: Localization files for multi-language support.
  - views: Blade templates shaping the user interface.

- **routes:** Defines web and console routes. The primary file is web.php for web routes.

- **storage:** Stores compiled Blade views, logs, and framework-generated files.

### Configuration

Laravel's flexibility is reflected in the **config** directory. Key configuration files include:

- **app.php:** General configuration, timezone settings, and locale.

- **database.php:** Database connection details, with support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server.

- **filesystems.php:** Configuration for file storage and cloud-based file systems.

- **mail.php:** Mail configuration, supporting various drivers like SMTP, Mailgun, and Sendmail.

## Database Setup

### Migration

Database migrations, located in **database/migrations**, play a vital role in version-controlling the database schema. Applying pending migrations is accomplished with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This ensures a seamless evolution of the database structure as the application advances.

### Database Connection

Fine-tune database connections in **config/database.php**, specifying parameters such as host, username, password, and database name. Laravel supports multiple database connections, allowing for flexibility in configuration.

### Eloquent ORM

CityEye Hospital leverages Laravel's Eloquent ORM for interacting with databases. Models in **app/Models** represent database tables, providing a powerful and expressive way to query the database.

## Testing

Quality assurance is paramount for CityEye Hospital, and extensive testing is conducted using PHPUnit.

### PHPUnit

The **tests** directory hosts PHPUnit test files, validating the functionality of each component. Execute tests using:
