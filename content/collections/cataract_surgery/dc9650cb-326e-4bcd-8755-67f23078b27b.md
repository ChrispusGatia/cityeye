description: |-
  A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the lens of the eye.
  The lens is normally transparent and is located behind the pupil (the dark center of the eye) and the iris (the coloured portion of the eye around the pupil). 
  The cloudiness in the lens restricts light from passing through the eye.
  This affects reading, night driving and distance vision.

  Causes of Cataract
  Cataracts can occur at any age but are very common in older people.
  Other causes of cataracts, besides age, include:
  Congenital (present at birth)
  Health problems, such as diabetes
  Medications, such as steroids
  Injury to the eye
