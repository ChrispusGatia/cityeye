  All persons with diabetes are at risk of getting diabetic retinopathy. In younger people with diabetes, the onset can be rapid, whereas in older people, it may come on more slowly. After 10 years of living with diabetes, most people will have some degree of retinopathy, but this is not usually sight-threatening.
  **Understanding Diabetes Retinopathy**
  Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that harms the eyes. High blood sugar levels damage the retinal blood vessels, leading to bleeding. If left untreated, it can lead to significant vision loss and even blindness.  
  **The retina** is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that enables you to see. It does this by converting light and images into signals that are sent to the brain. Damage to the retinal blood vessels can cause blurry vision or vision loss.
  Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Therefore, if you have diabetes, do not wait for symptoms, but instead undergo a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year.
  As the disease progresses, you may experience some of these symptoms:
  - Poor reading vision
  - Blurred and fluctuating vision (often linked to blood sugar levels)
  - Floaters and flashes
  - Sudden loss of vision

    item: 'Diabetes management and awareness: Through our work, we have also noticed that the biggest missing link in the treatment of diabetes-related eye health issues is the lack of knowledge on the complications that diabetes can have on one‚Äôs body organs. Therefore, our Diabetes Clinic works with our Outreach Program to continuously create awareness of diabetes and eye health information.'
