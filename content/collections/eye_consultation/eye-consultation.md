description: 'City Eye Hospital (CEH) offers regular eye exams that help detect any problems early. Most eye diseases can be treated or managed with greater success if detected early on. Our comprehensive eye exam helps determine your overall eye health and also screens for any eye conditions or diseases, including glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy. Eye exams can also reveal a range of other undiagnosed health issues, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, as these conditions affect your vision as well.'
