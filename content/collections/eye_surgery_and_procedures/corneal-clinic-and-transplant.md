service_description: |-
  The cornea is the transparent outer layer that covers the front of the eye, which together with the sclera (the thick, white part of your eye) and the conjunctiva (thin tissue that covers the sclera) protects your eye from damage. The eyelids function to protect these surface structures of your eye and to keep them moist each time you blink.

  **Treatment of Corneal Conditions**
  The cornea specialists at City Eye Hospital provide advanced medical and surgical treatment for all conditions and disorders of the cornea.
  Treatments for corneal conditions may comprise oral medications or surgical intervention. We also provide **corneal transplants** when it is required to improve your vision.
