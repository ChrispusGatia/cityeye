body_description: 'Eye/vision cover tends to be an additional/opt-in component in several health insurance covers. Some covers require predetermination of medical necessity before eye care is rendered. You may wish to contact your insurance company to verify if eye care is a covered benefit in your health insurance plan. Please note we accept M-PESA and VISA payments too; we do not accept payment in the form of cash or personal cheques.'
