      At City Eye Hospital, we are committed to providing safe and high-quality care to every patient who walks through our doors. Patient safety is paramount in healthcare. It ensures patients receive the right care at the right time, preventing adverse events and improving overall outcomes.

      When patients feel safe and confident in their care, they are more likely to adhere to treatment plans and achieve better health outcomes. At City Eye Hospital, we have implemented several measures to ensure patient safety.
        
      We adhere to strict infection prevention and control protocols to minimize the risk of healthcare-associated infections. We provide patients with clear information about their treatment plan, medications, and expected outcomes. We are committed to continuous improvement and regularly review our patient safety practices to identify areas for improvement.
