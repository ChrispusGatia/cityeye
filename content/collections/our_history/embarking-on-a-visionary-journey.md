      <h4>UHEAL Opens Its Doors</h4>

      The journey of what was to become one of the leading specialist eye hospitals in Sub-Saharan Africa began in 2009 when Upper Hill Eye and Laser Centre (UHEAL), a state-of-the-art eye diagnostic centre equipped with an ultramodern eye theatre, opened its doors to patients at Upper Hill Medical Centre in Nairobi.

      <h4>The Foundation is Born</h4>

      UHEAL, led by Dr. Kibata Githeko, an Ophthalmologist specializing in Paediatric and Vitreo-Retinal Surgery, recognized the urgent need for early intervention in diabetic eye complications. In partnership with the World Diabetes Foundation, UHEAL launched an eye care foundation to serve underserved communities through outreach clinics.

      <h4>CEH is Launched</h4>

      City Eye Hospital (CEH) is established to serve the growing demand for quality and affordable eye care. Conveniently located along Ngong Road, CEH was initially launched as an affiliate of UHEAL. Three years later, UHEAL acquired CEH. The merger saw the UHEAL branch at Upper Hill Medical Centre transformed into CEH’s Appointment-only Clinic and the Ngong Road branch into CEH’s walk-in Main Hospital.

      <h4>CEH Nyeri and Ngong Established</h4>

      Noticing how much our patients appreciated the convenience of having state-of-the-art eye care in an exceptionally welcoming environment locally, CEH began to expand outside the capital, opening two new branches in Nyeri Town and Ngong Town, as part of the hospital’s expansion plan grounded in improving access to quality and affordable eye care for those residing outside the capital.
