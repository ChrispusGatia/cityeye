CEH Foundation has also commissioned a state-of-the-art, camera-based diabetic screening (Fundus Camera) that is used in the outreach programme for the effective diagnosis of diabetic eye disease. 
The new technology assists in the early diagnosis and intervention of diabetic eye disease to prevent needless blindness.

<h4>Support CEH Foundation</h4>

The community outreach programme is made possible through funds raised by the City Eye Foundation.
