    card_description: |-
      Hypertensive retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Therefore, if you have hypertension, do not wait for symptoms, but instead undergo a comprehensive eye exam at least once a year.
      As the disease progresses, you may experience headaches, double or dim vision and sometimes sudden loss of vision.
