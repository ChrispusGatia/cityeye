  Who We Are
  Founded in 2015, City Eye Hospital (CEH) is devoted to providing quality eye care to all patients. Our approach blends a walk-in Main Hospital with an Appointment Clinic and a branch in Nyeri. The Main Hospital is conveniently located on Ngong Road, the Appointment Clinic at Upper Hill Medical Centre, and the Nyeri Branch on Mbuni Road. CEH is the Data Controller for the information it collects and records, uses, and stores about its patients, carers, staff, and the public. CEH processes its data electronically and using paper-based systems.
