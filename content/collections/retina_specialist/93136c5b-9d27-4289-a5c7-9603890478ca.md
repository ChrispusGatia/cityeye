service_description: |-
  The retina is the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye that converts light into neural signs for the brain to interpret as the images we see. Retinal disease is a range of disorders that affect the retina whose early symptoms include: The sudden appearance of floaters in one’s vision, Blurred vision, Flashes of light in one or both eyes, Loss of vision and Retinal conditions.

  **Treatment of Retinal Conditions**
  The retina specialists at City Eye Hospital diagnose, manage and treat diseases that affect the retina and the vitreous—the middle of the eye is filled with a clear gel called vitreous that is attached to the retina.
