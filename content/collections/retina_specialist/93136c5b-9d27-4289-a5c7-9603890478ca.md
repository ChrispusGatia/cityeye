description: |-
  The retina is the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye that converts light into neural signs for the brain to interpret as the images we see.
  Retinal disease is a range of disorders that affect the retina whose early symptoms include:
  The sudden appearance of floaters in one’s vision
  Blurred vision
  Flashes of light in one or both eyes
  Loss of vision
  Retinal conditions

  Treatment of Retinal Conditions 
  The retina specialists at City Eye Hospital diagnose, manage and treat diseases that affect the retina and the vitreous—the middle of the eye is filled with a clear gel called vitreous that is attached to the retina.
  Retinal conditions we treat at City Eye Hospital include:
  Age-related macular degeneration 
  Macular hole 
  Retinal detachment
  Diabetic retinopathy 
  Foreign body removal and trauma treatment
