      **Cataract Outreaches**
      Our cataract outreaches are mainly done through community camps held at central locations in the community, such as churches, county government hospitals and social halls. The local community gets access to free eye screening at the camps. Those identified to have cataracts benefit from subsidized surgical interventions. A cataract is an opacity of the natural eye lens that can lead to blindness if left untreated. However, it can be treated successfully through surgical interventions when caught early. Our cataract outreaches, made possible thanks to the support of our partners—the Fred Hollows Foundation and our very own CEH Foundation—also conduct community eye health awareness forums where we disseminate information on the causes, symptoms and treatment of cataracts.

      **Corporate Outreaches**
      Our corporate outreach program comprises City Eye Hospital partnering with organisations looking to bring world-class eye care closer to their staff by holding eye health outreaches at their office premises. 
      During the outreach, the staff members are taken through our products and services by our team. 
      They also get a chance to get an eye screening and treatment on site. Where the staff members need more specialised intervention, they are referred to our facilities for further treatment.

      **Diabetic Retinopathy Outreaches**
      Our diabetic retinopathy outreach program works in partnership with the county government health facilities and other Non-Communicable Disease Clinics. 
      This enables us to have ongoing diabetic screenings at hospitals with established Non-Communicable Disease Clinics. 
      All patients with diabetes at the clinics are screened for any eye complications using the CEH-commissioned Fundus Camera, which in a non-invasive method to effectively screen for diabetic eye disease. 
      Those found with complications are referred for treatment while those that are found to not have any complications are advised on the importance of having regular eye screening when one is diabetic, as early diagnosis and treatment of diabetic eye disease is crucial in preventing blindness.
