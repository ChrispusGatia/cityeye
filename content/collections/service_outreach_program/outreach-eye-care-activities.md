  Discover your perfect eyewear at City Eye's Outreach Program, where we actively engage in community outreach and social marketing of eye care activities. Community Outreach in eye care is the practice of taking health care to parts of the community that have no access and awareness of such services. It involves conducting eye camps involving the local community as partners.
