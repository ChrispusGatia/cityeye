  The eye is one of the organs that can be affected by uncontrolled or undetected hypertension. Like high blood sugar, high blood pressure can cause major complications in your eyes, such as hypertensive retinopathy, which is the damage to the retina from high blood pressure.

  **The retina** is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that enables you to see. It does this by converting light and images into signals that are sent to the brain. Damage to the retinal blood vessels can cause blurry vision or even blindness. 

  **Hypertensive retinopathy** often has no early warning signs. Therefore, if you have hypertension, do not wait for symptoms, but instead undergo a comprehensive eye exam at least once a year.
  As the disease progresses, you may experience headaches, double or dim vision and sometimes sudden loss of vision.
