Hello Fred,

Please adhere to the following guidelines for the sample pictures/images:

1. Ensure that the size remains consistent across all images.
2. Use your creativity to design images that you believe will complement each folder.
3. Each folder should contain images specific to its category (e.g., Services folder should include images related to the services we offer) and these images can vary in design.
4. The About folder should contain images intended for the navigation bar, and again, designs can vary.

Note: Please refer to the attached zipped file as an example of the desired shape and dimensions. Create your own designs for each specified folder.
